# Snips.dev

## A Visual Sharing Platform for Developers. An Application made by Shannon Lockett.

## Executive Summary

Snips.dev is a specialized social platform where developers, AI enthusiasts, and web professionals can capture, share, and discuss visual elements from their digital workspace. Users can take screenshots of code snippets, project layouts, website designs, AI outputs, and other technical content, creating a curated gallery that showcases their interests and work while connecting with like-minded professionals.

Unlike general image-sharing platforms, Snips.dev is built specifically for the tech community, with features tailored to the needs and interests of developers and technical professionals. The platform will be available as both a web application and mobile app, ensuring accessibility across devices and workflows.

## Market Opportunity

### Target Audience

- Software developers and programmers
- Web designers and front-end developers
- UI/UX professionals
- AI researchers and enthusiasts
- Computer science students
- Tech startups and teams

### Market Size

The global developer population exceeded 24 million in 2023 and continues to grow at approximately 6% annually. Within this market:

- 65% use some form of social media specifically for professional networking
- 83% contribute to or consume content from developer communities

### Problem Statement

Current platforms have significant limitations for technical content sharing:
1. General social media platforms lack developer-specific features
2. Code-sharing sites focus on text rather than visual elements
3. Screenshot tools lack community and social features
4. Developer forums are text-heavy with limited visual capabilities
5. Existing solutions don't provide good organization systems for visual technical content
